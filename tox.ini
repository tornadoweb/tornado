# Tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs.  This configuration file will run the tornado
# test suite on all supported python versions.  To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
#
# This configuration requires tox 1.8 or higher.
#
# Installation tips:
# When building pycurl on my macports-based setup, I need to either set the
# environment variable ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64' or use
# 'port install curl +universal' to get both 32- and 64-bit versions of
# libcurl.
