# Tox (http://codespeak.net/~hpk/tox/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs.  This configuration file will run the tornado
# test suite on all supported python versions.  To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.
#
# See also tornado/test/run_pyversion_tests.py, which is faster but
# less thorough.
#
# On my macports-based setup, the environment variable
# ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64' must be set when building pycurl, and a
# symlink from mysql_config to mysql_config5 must exist when building
# MySQL-python.
[tox]
# "-full" variants include optional dependencies, to ensure
# that things work both in a bare install and with all the extras.
