"""``tornado.gen`` implements generator-based coroutines.

.. note::

   The "decorator and generator" approach in this module is a
   precursor to native coroutines (using ``async def`` and ``await``)
   which were introduced in Python 3.5. Applications that do not
   require compatibility with older versions of Python should use
   native coroutines instead. Some parts of this module are still
   useful with native coroutines, notably `multi`, `sleep`,
   `WaitIterator`, and `with_timeout`. Some of these functions have
   counterparts in the `asyncio` module which may be used as well,
   although the two may not necessarily be 100% compatible.

Coroutines provide an easier way to work in an asynchronous
environment than chaining callbacks. Code using coroutines is
technically asynchronous, but it is written as a single generator
instead of a collection of separate functions.

For example, the following callback-based asynchronous handler:

.. testcode::

    class AsyncHandler(RequestHandler):
        @asynchronous
        def get(self):
            http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
            http_client.fetch("http://example.com",
                              callback=self.on_fetch)

        def on_fetch(self, response):
            do_something_with_response(response)
            self.render("template.html")

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

could be written with ``gen`` as:

.. testcode::

    class GenAsyncHandler(RequestHandler):
        @gen.coroutine
        def get(self):
            http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
            response = yield http_client.fetch("http://example.com")
            do_something_with_response(response)
            self.render("template.html")

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

Most asynchronous functions in Tornado return a `.Future`;
yielding this object returns its ``Future.result``.

You can also yield a list or dict of ``Futures``, which will be
started at the same time and run in parallel; a list or dict of results will
be returned when they are all finished:

.. testcode::

    @gen.coroutine
    def get(self):
        http_client = AsyncHTTPClient()
        response1, response2 = yield [http_client.fetch(url1),
                                      http_client.fetch(url2)]
        response_dict = yield dict(response3=http_client.fetch(url3),
                                   response4=http_client.fetch(url4))
        response3 = response_dict['response3']
        response4 = response_dict['response4']

.. testoutput::
   :hide:

If the `~functools.singledispatch` library is available (standard in
Python 3.4, available via the `singledispatch
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/singledispatch>`_ package on older
versions), additional types of objects may be yielded. Tornado includes
support for ``asyncio.Future`` and Twisted's ``Deferred`` class when
``tornado.platform.asyncio`` and ``tornado.platform.twisted`` are imported.
See the `convert_yielded` function to extend this mechanism.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   Dict support added.

.. versionchanged:: 4.1
   Support added for yielding ``asyncio`` Futures and Twisted Deferreds
   via ``singledispatch``.

def coroutine(func):
    """Decorator for asynchronous generators.

    Any generator that yields objects from this module must be wrapped
    in either this decorator or `engine`.

    Coroutines may "return" by raising the special exception
    `Return(value) <Return>`.  In Python 3.3+, it is also possible for
    the function to simply use the ``return value`` statement (prior to
    Python 3.3 generators were not allowed to also return values).
    In all versions of Python a coroutine that simply wishes to exit
    early may use the ``return`` statement without a value.

    Functions with this decorator return a `.Future`.  Additionally,
    they may be called with a ``callback`` keyword argument, which
    will be invoked with the future's result when it resolves.  If the
    coroutine fails, the callback will not be run and an exception
    will be raised into the surrounding `.StackContext`.  The
    ``callback`` argument is not visible inside the decorated
    function; it is handled by the decorator itself.

    .. warning::

       When exceptions occur inside a coroutine, the exception
       information will be stored in the `.Future` object. You must
       examine the result of the `.Future` object, or the exception
       may go unnoticed by your code. This means yielding the function
       if called from another coroutine, using something like
       `.IOLoop.run_sync` for top-level calls, or passing the `.Future`
       to `.IOLoop.add_future`.

    .. deprecated:: 5.1

       The ``callback`` argument is deprecated and will be removed in 6.0.

    Yielding a set of futures like this:

    pauses the coroutine until both ``future1`` and ``future2``
    return, and then restarts the coroutine with the results of both
    futures. If either future is an exception, the expression will
    raise that exception and all the results will be lost.

    If you need to get the result of each future as soon as possible,
    or if you need the result of some futures even if others produce
    errors, you can use ``WaitIterator``::

      wait_iterator = gen.WaitIterator(future1, future2)

                  result, wait_iterator.current_future,
                  wait_iterator.current_index))

    Because results are returned as soon as they are available the
    output from the iterator *will not be in the same order as the
    input arguments*. If you need to know which future produced the
    current result, you can use the attributes
    ``WaitIterator.current_future``, or ``WaitIterator.current_index``
    to get the index of the future from the input list. (if keyword
    arguments were used in the construction of the `WaitIterator`,
    ``current_index`` will use the corresponding keyword).

    On Python 3.5, `WaitIterator` implements the async iterator
    protocol, so it can be used with the ``async for`` statement (note
    that in this version the entire iteration is aborted if any value
    raises an exception, while the previous example can continue past
    individual errors)::

    results. If ``children`` is a list, the result is a list of
    results in the same order; if it is a dict, the result is a dict
    with the same keys.

    If any of the inputs are `YieldPoints <YieldPoint>`, the returned
    yieldable object is a `YieldPoint`. Otherwise, returns a `.Future`.
    This means that the result of `multi` can be used in a native

    the ``quiet_exceptions`` argument.

    This function is available under the names ``multi()`` and ``Multi()``
