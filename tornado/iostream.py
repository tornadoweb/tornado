class IOStream(object):
    r"""A utility class to write to and read from a non-blocking socket.

    We support a non-blocking ``write()`` and a family of ``read_*()`` methods.
    All of the methods take callbacks (since writing and reading are
    non-blocking and asynchronous).

    The socket parameter may either be connected or unconnected.  For
    server operations the socket is the result of calling socket.accept().
    For client operations the socket is created with socket.socket(),
    and may either be connected before passing it to the IOStream or
    connected with IOStream.connect.

    When a stream is closed due to an error, the IOStream's `error`
    attribute contains the exception object.

        an IOLoop callback.  Note that in both cases, the callback is
        run asynchronously with `_run_callback`.

        To detect closed connections, we must have called

        much as possible so we don't have to set an `IOLoop.ERROR`
        listener that will be overwritten by the next slow-path
        operation.  As long as there are callbacks scheduled for
        fast-path ops, those callbacks may do more reads.
        If a sequence of fast-path ops do not end in a slow-path op,
        (e.g. for an @asynchronous long-poll request), we must add
        the error handler.  This is done in `_run_callback` and `write`
