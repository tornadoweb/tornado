    :alt: Tornado Web Server

`Tornado <https://www.tornadoweb.org>`_ is a Python web framework and
asynchronous networking library, originally developed at `FriendFeed
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed>`_.  By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado
can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for
`long polling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling>`_,
`WebSockets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket>`_, and other
applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.

Hello, world
------------

Here is a simple "Hello, world" example web app for Tornado::

    import asyncio
    import tornado

    class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            self.write("Hello, world")

    def make_app():
        return tornado.web.Application([
            (r"/", MainHandler),
        ])

    async def main():
        app = make_app()
        app.listen(8888)
        await asyncio.Event().wait()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

This example does not use any of Tornado's asynchronous features; for
that see this `simple chat room
<https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/tree/stable/demos/chat>`_.

Threads and WSGI
----------------

Tornado is different from most Python web frameworks. It is not based
on `WSGI <https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and it is
typically run with only one thread per process. See the :doc:`guide`
for more on Tornado's approach to asynchronous programming.

While some support of WSGI is available in the `tornado.wsgi` module,
it is not a focus of development and most applications should be
written to use Tornado's own interfaces (such as `tornado.web`)
directly instead of using WSGI.

In general, Tornado code is not thread-safe. The only method in
Tornado that is safe to call from other threads is
`.IOLoop.add_callback`. You can also use `.IOLoop.run_in_executor` to
asynchronously run a blocking function on another thread, but note
that the function passed to ``run_in_executor`` should avoid
referencing any Tornado objects. ``run_in_executor`` is the
recommended way to interact with blocking code.

``asyncio`` Integration
-----------------------

Tornado is integrated with the standard library `asyncio` module and
shares the same event loop (by default since Tornado 5.0). In general,
libraries designed for use with `asyncio` can be mixed freely with
Tornado.


Installation
------------

::

    pip install tornado

Tornado is listed in `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tornado/>`_ and
can be installed with ``pip``. Note that the source distribution
includes demo applications that are not present when Tornado is
installed in this way, so you may wish to download a copy of the
source tarball or clone the `git repository
<https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado>`_ as well.

**Prerequisites**: Tornado requires Python 3. The following
optional packages may be useful:

* `pycurl <http://pycurl.io/>`_ is used by the optional
  ``tornado.curl_httpclient``.  Libcurl version 7.22 or higher is required.
* `pycares <https://pypi.org/project/pycares/>`_ is an alternative
  non-blocking DNS resolver that can be used when threads are not
  appropriate.

**Platforms**: Tornado is designed for Unix-like platforms, with best
performance and scalability on systems supporting ``epoll`` (Linux),
``kqueue`` (BSD/macOS), or ``/dev/poll`` (Solaris).

Tornado will also run on Windows, although this configuration is not
officially supported or recommended for production use. Some features
are missing on Windows (including multi-process mode) and scalability
is limited (Even though Tornado is built on ``asyncio``, which
supports Windows, Tornado does not use the APIs that are necessary for
scalable networking on Windows).
