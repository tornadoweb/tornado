What's new in Tornado 6.2.0
===========================

Jun XX, 2022
------------

Deprecation notice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- TODO py310 deprecations
- ``TwistedResolver`` and ``CaresResolver`` are deprecated and will be
  removed in Tornado 7.0.
- `.AnyThreadEventLoopPolicy` is deprecated. This class controls the creation of
  the "current" event loop so it will be removed when that concept is no longer
  supported.
- `.IOLoop.make_current` and `.IOLoop.clear_current` are deprecated. In the
  future the concept of a "current" event loop as distinct from one that is
  currently running will be removed.
- The `.IOLoop` constructor is deprecated. Use `.IOLoop.current` when the loop
  is already running instead. 
- `.AsyncTestCase` (and `.AsyncHTTPTestCase`) are deprecated. Use
  `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` instead.
- Multi-process `.TCPServer.bind`/`.TCPServer.start` is deprecated. See
  `.TCPServer` docs for supported alternatives.

General changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The minimum supported Python version is now 3.7.
- SSL certificate verfication and hostname checks are now enabled by default in
  more places (primarily in client-side usage of `.SSLIOStream`).
- Various improvements to type hints throughout the package.
- CI has moved from Travis and Appveyor to Github Actions.  

`tornado.gen`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a bug in which ``WaitIterator.current_index`` could be incorrect.
- ``tornado.gen.TimeoutError``` is now an alias for `asyncio.TimeoutError`.

`tornado.http1connection`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``max_body_size`` may now be set to zero to disallow a non-empty body.
- ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` is now recognized case-insensitively.

`tornado.httpclient`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``curl_httpclient`` now supports non-ASCII (ISO-8859-1) header values, same as
  ``simple_httpclient``.

`tornado.ioloop`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.PeriodicCallback` now understands coroutines and will not start multiple
  copies if a previous invocation runs too long.
- `.PeriodicCallback` now accepts `datetime.timedelta` objects in addition to
  numbers of milliseconds.
- Avoid logging "Event loop is closed" during shutdown-related race conditions.
- Tornado no longer calls `logging.basicConfig` when starting an IOLoop; this
  has been unnecessary since Python 3.2 added a logger of last resort.

`tornado.iostream`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.SSLIOStream` now supports reading more than 2GB at a time.
- ``IOStream.write`` now supports typed `memoryview` objects.

`tornado.locale`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.load_gettext_translations` no longer logs errors when language directories
  exist but do not contain the expected file.

`tornado.netutil`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.is_valid_ip` no longer raises exceptions when the input is too long.
- The default resolver now uses the same methods (and thread pool) as `asyncio`.

`tornado.tcpserver`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.TCPServer.listen` now supports more arguments to pass through to
  `.netutil.bind_sockets`.

`tornado.testing`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.bind_unused_port` now takes an optional ``address`` argument.
- Wrapped test methods now include the ``__wrapped__`` attribute.
  
`tornado.web`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When using a custom `.StaticFileHandler` subclass, the ``reset()`` method is
  now called on this subclass instead of the base class.
- Improved handling of the ``Accept-Language`` header.
- `.Application.listen` now supports more arguments to pass through to
  `.netutil.bind_sockets`.

`tornado.websocket`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `.WebSocketClientConnection.write_message` now accepts `dict` arguments for
  consistency with `.WebSocketHandler.write_message`.
- `.WebSocketClientConnection.write_message` now raises an exception as
  documented if the connection is already closed.
