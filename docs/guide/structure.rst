Structure of a Tornado web application
======================================

A Tornado web application generally consists of one or more
`.RequestHandler` subclasses, an `.Application` object which
routes incoming requests to handlers, and a ``main()`` function
to start the server.

A minimal "hello world" example looks something like this:

.. testcode::

    import asyncio
    import tornado

    class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            self.write("Hello, world")

    def make_app():
        return tornado.web.Application([
            (r"/", MainHandler),
        ])

    async def main():
        app = make_app()
        app.listen(8888)
        shutdown_event = asyncio.Event()
        await shutdown_event.wait()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

The ``main`` coroutine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with Tornado 6.2 and Python 3.10, the recommended pattern for starting
a Tornado application is to create a ``main`` coroutine to be run with
`asyncio.run`. (In older versions, it was common to do initialization in a
regular function and then start the event loop with
``IOLoop.current().start()``. However, this pattern produces deprecation
warnings starting in Python 3.10 and will break in some future version of
Python.)

When the ``main`` function returns, the program exits, so most of the time for a
web server ``main`` should run forever. Waiting on an `asyncio.Event` whose
``set()`` method is never called is a convenient way to make an asynchronus
function run forever. (and if you wish to have ``main`` exit early as a part of
a graceful shutdown procedure, you can call ``shutdown_event.set()`` to make it
exit).

The ``Application`` object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `.Application` object is responsible for global configuration, including
the routing table that maps requests to handlers.

The routing table is a list of `.URLSpec` objects (or tuples), each of
which contains (at least) a regular expression and a handler class.
Order matters; the first matching rule is used.  If the regular
expression contains capturing groups, these groups are the *path
arguments* and will be passed to the handler's HTTP method.  If a
dictionary is passed as the third element of the `.URLSpec`, it
supplies the *initialization arguments* which will be passed to
`.RequestHandler.initialize`.  Finally, the `.URLSpec` may have a
name, which will allow it to be used with
`.RequestHandler.reverse_url`.

For example, in this fragment the root URL ``/`` is mapped to
``MainHandler`` and URLs of the form ``/story/`` followed by a number
are mapped to ``StoryHandler``.  That number is passed (as a string) to
``StoryHandler.get``.

::
import tornado.ioloop
from tornado.web import Application, RequestHandler, url

    class MainHandler(RequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            self.write('<a href="%s">link to story 1</a>' %
                       self.reverse_url("story", "1"))

    class StoryHandler(RequestHandler):
        def initialize(self, db):
            self.db = db

        def get(self, story_id):
            self.write("this is story %s" % story_id)

    app = Application([
        url(r"/", MainHandler),
        url(r"/story/([0-9]+)", StoryHandler, dict(db=db), name="story")
        ])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()

The `.Application` constructor takes many keyword arguments that
can be used to customize the behavior of the application and enable
optional features; see `.Application.settings` for the complete list.

Subclassing ``RequestHandler``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the work of a Tornado web application is done in subclasses
of `.RequestHandler`.  The main entry point for a handler subclass
is a method named after the HTTP method being handled: ``get()``,
``post()``, etc.  Each handler may define one or more of these methods
to handle different HTTP actions.  As described above, these methods
will be called with arguments corresponding to the capturing groups
of the routing rule that matched.

Within a handler, call methods such as `.RequestHandler.render` or
`.RequestHandler.write` to produce a response.  ``render()`` loads a
`.Template` by name and renders it with the given
arguments. ``write()`` is used for non-template-based output; it
accepts strings, bytes, and dictionaries (dicts will be encoded as
JSON).

Many methods in `.RequestHandler` are designed to be overridden in
subclasses and be used throughout the application.  It is common
to define a ``BaseHandler`` class that overrides methods such as
`~.RequestHandler.write_error` and `~.RequestHandler.get_current_user`
and then subclass your own ``BaseHandler`` instead of `.RequestHandler`
for all your specific handlers.

Handling request input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The request handler can access the object representing the current
request with ``self.request``.  See the class definition for
`~tornado.httputil.HTTPServerRequest` for a complete list of
attributes.

Request data in the formats used by HTML forms will be parsed for you
and is made available in methods like `~.RequestHandler.get_query_argument`
and `~.RequestHandler.get_body_argument`.

.. testcode::

    class MyFormHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
        def get(self):
            self.write('<html><body><form action="/myform" method="POST">'
                       '<input type="text" name="message">'
                       '<input type="submit" value="Submit">'
                       '</form></body></html>')

        def post(self):
            self.set_header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
            self.write("You wrote " + self.get_body_argument("message"))

Since the HTML form encoding is ambiguous as to whether an argument is
a single value or a list with one element, `.RequestHandler` has
distinct methods to allow the application to indicate whether or not
it expects a list.  For lists, use
`~.RequestHandler.get_query_arguments` and
`~.RequestHandler.get_body_arguments` instead of their singular
counterparts.

Files uploaded via a form are available in ``self.request.files``,
which maps names (the name of the HTML ``<input type="file">``
element) to a list of files. Each file is a dictionary of the form
``{"filename":..., "content_type":..., "body":...}``.  The ``files``
object is only present if the files were uploaded with a form wrapper
(i.e. a ``multipart/form-data`` Content-Type); if this format was not used
the raw uploaded data is available in ``self.request.body``.
By default uploaded files are fully buffered in memory; if you need to
handle files that are too large to comfortably keep in memory see the
`.stream_request_body` class decorator.

In the demos directory,
`file_receiver.py <https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/tree/stable/demos/file_upload/>`_
shows both methods of receiving file uploads.

Due to the quirks of the HTML form encoding (e.g. the ambiguity around
singular versus plural arguments), Tornado does not attempt to unify
form arguments with other types of input.  In particular, we do not
parse JSON request bodies.  Applications that wish to use JSON instead
of form-encoding may override `~.RequestHandler.prepare` to parse their
requests::

    def prepare(self):
        if self.request.headers.get("Content-Type", "").startswith("application/json"):
            self.json_args = json.loads(self.request.body)
        else:
            self.json_args = None

Overriding RequestHandler methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to ``get()``/``post()``/etc, certain other methods in
`.RequestHandler` are designed to be overridden by subclasses when
necessary. On every request, the following sequence of calls takes
place:

1. A new `.RequestHandler` object is created on each request.
2. `~.RequestHandler.initialize()` is called with the initialization
   arguments from the `.Application` configuration. ``initialize``
   should typically just save the arguments passed into member
   variables; it may not produce any output or call methods like
   `~.RequestHandler.send_error`.
3. `~.RequestHandler.prepare()` is called. This is most useful in a
   base class shared by all of your handler subclasses, as ``prepare``
   is called no matter which HTTP method is used. ``prepare`` may
   produce output; if it calls `~.RequestHandler.finish` (or
   ``redirect``, etc), processing stops here.
4. One of the HTTP methods is called: ``get()``, ``post()``, ``put()``,
   etc. If the URL regular expression contains capturing groups, they
   are passed as arguments to this method.
5. When the request is finished, `~.RequestHandler.on_finish()` is
   called. This is generally after ``get()`` or another HTTP method
   returns.

All methods designed to be overridden are noted as such in the
`.RequestHandler` documentation.  Some of the most commonly
overridden methods include:

- `~.RequestHandler.write_error` -
  outputs HTML for use on error pages.
- `~.RequestHandler.on_connection_close` - called when the client
  disconnects; applications may choose to detect this case and halt
  further processing.  Note that there is no guarantee that a closed
  connection can be detected promptly.
- `~.RequestHandler.get_current_user` - see :ref:`user-authentication`.
- `~.RequestHandler.get_user_locale` - returns `.Locale` object to use
  for the current user.
- `~.RequestHandler.set_default_headers` - may be used to set
  additional headers on the response (such as a custom ``Server``
  header).

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a handler raises an exception, Tornado will call
`.RequestHandler.write_error` to generate an error page.
`tornado.web.HTTPError` can be used to generate a specified status
code; all other exceptions return a 500 status.

The default error page includes a stack trace in debug mode and a
one-line description of the error (e.g. "500: Internal Server Error")
otherwise.  To produce a custom error page, override
`RequestHandler.write_error` (probably in a base class shared by all
your handlers).  This method may produce output normally via
methods such as `~RequestHandler.write` and `~RequestHandler.render`.
If the error was caused by an exception, an ``exc_info`` triple will
be passed as a keyword argument (note that this exception is not
guaranteed to be the current exception in `sys.exc_info`, so
``write_error`` must use e.g.  `traceback.format_exception` instead of
`traceback.format_exc`).

It is also possible to generate an error page from regular handler
methods instead of ``write_error`` by calling
`~.RequestHandler.set_status`, writing a response, and returning.
The special exception `tornado.web.Finish` may be raised to terminate
the handler without calling ``write_error`` in situations where simply
returning is not convenient.

For 404 errors, use the ``default_handler_class`` `Application setting
<.Application.settings>`.  This handler should override
`~.RequestHandler.prepare` instead of a more specific method like
``get()`` so it works with any HTTP method.  It should produce its
error page as described above: either by raising a ``HTTPError(404)``
and overriding ``write_error``, or calling ``self.set_status(404)``
and producing the response directly in ``prepare()``.

Redirection
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two main ways you can redirect requests in Tornado:
`.RequestHandler.redirect` and with the `.RedirectHandler`.

You can use ``self.redirect()`` within a `.RequestHandler` method to
redirect users elsewhere. There is also an optional parameter
``permanent`` which you can use to indicate that the redirection is
considered permanent.  The default value of ``permanent`` is
``False``, which generates a ``302 Found`` HTTP response code and is
appropriate for things like redirecting users after successful
``POST`` requests.  If ``permanent`` is ``True``, the ``301 Moved
Permanently`` HTTP response code is used, which is useful for
e.g. redirecting to a canonical URL for a page in an SEO-friendly
manner.

`.RedirectHandler` lets you configure redirects directly in your
`.Application` routing table.  For example, to configure a single
static redirect::

    app = tornado.web.Application([
        url(r"/app", tornado.web.RedirectHandler,
            dict(url="http://itunes.apple.com/my-app-id")),
        ])

`.RedirectHandler` also supports regular expression substitutions.
The following rule redirects all requests beginning with ``/pictures/``
to the prefix ``/photos/`` instead::

    app = tornado.web.Application([
        url(r"/photos/(.*)", MyPhotoHandler),
        url(r"/pictures/(.*)", tornado.web.RedirectHandler,
            dict(url=r"/photos/{0}")),
        ])

Unlike `.RequestHandler.redirect`, `.RedirectHandler` uses permanent
redirects by default.  This is because the routing table does not change
at runtime and is presumed to be permanent, while redirects found in
handlers are likely to be the result of other logic that may change.
To send a temporary redirect with a `.RedirectHandler`, add
``permanent=False`` to the `.RedirectHandler` initialization arguments.

Asynchronous handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain handler methods (including ``prepare()`` and the HTTP verb
methods ``get()``/``post()``/etc) may be overridden as coroutines to
make the handler asynchronous.

For example, here is a simple handler using a coroutine:

.. testcode::

    class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
        async def get(self):
            http = tornado.httpclient.AsyncHTTPClient()
            response = await http.fetch("http://friendfeed-api.com/v2/feed/bret")
            json = tornado.escape.json_decode(response.body)
            self.write("Fetched " + str(len(json["entries"])) + " entries "
                       "from the FriendFeed API")

For a more advanced asynchronous example, take a look at the `chat
example application
<https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/tree/stable/demos/chat>`_, which
implements an AJAX chat room using `long polling
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling>`_.  Users
of long polling may want to override ``on_connection_close()`` to
clean up after the client closes the connection (but see that method's
docstring for caveats).
